:AboutMe

Hi, I'm Han, Software Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan.

I'm the creator of [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages), and core member of [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/). My journey in programming began in high school, and today I focus on maintaining and contributing to projects related to the Vite and Vue ecosystem.

My interests span a wide range of topics, including Kubernetes, Linux, virtualization, networking, smart home automation, IoT, playing guitar, Japanese music, anime, mountain climbing, rock climbing, and most recently, 3D printing.
